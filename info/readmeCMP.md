Generalised Convoy Movement Problem (GCMP)
==========================================

**File:** [cmp.zip](../data/cmp.zip)

The convoy movement problem (CMP) is a combinatorial optimisation problem. It is a vehicle routing and scheduling problem in which encounters of vehicles are avoided and the lengths of vehicles play a role.

This dataset is generated by Hamid Mokhtar, Mohan Krishnamoorthy, Niraj Ramesh Dayama, and Ram Kumar P. N., the authors of "New Approaches for
Solving the Convoy Movement Problem".

There are 5 parameters V, n, m, $\rho$, $l^u$, which respectively denote the version of the dataset, the number of nodes in the network, the number of convoys, the arc density of the network, and the maximum allowed travel time. The GCMP instance names in this dataset include all four parameters. Furthermore, we generated a number of instances with similar specifications. All parameters and the version of instances are included in the names of instances using appropriate prefixes. The format of
names is as follows:

> V.n.m.ρ_lu.txt

For example, the instance D.30.05.65_15k.txt is the version D, with a network on 30 nodes, 5 convoys, arc density of ρ=0.65, and maximum travel time of l^u = 15000 for all convoys.
