<h1>The multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem (MDVSP) dataset</h1>
<h3><br />By Sarang Kulkarni, Mohan Krishnamoorthy, Abhiram Ranade, Andreas Ernst, and Rahul Patil; Jan 2018</h3>
<p>The directory contains sixty instances of the MDVSP. <br />Each instance file is named as RN-m-n-k.dat, denoting the 'k'th instance involving 'm' depots and 'n' trips. <br />Each instance contains following information:<br />1. m - number of depots<br />2. n - number of trips<br />3. l - number of locations<br />4. v_i - the maximum number of vehicles in depot i = {1,...,m}<br />5. Trip information of each trip i: start time (s_i), start location (p_i), end time (e_i), and end location (q_i)<br />6. Travel matrix: Time to travel between any two locations l_i to l_j: d(l_i,l_j) <br />Note: Locations are numbered from 0 to l-1. Locations {0,...,m-1} are depot-locations (locations of depots) and locations {m,...,l-1} are trip-locations(where trips start/end).</p>
<p>Format of each instance is as follows:</p>
<p>first line: m n l <br />second line: m entries, one for each v_i, i = {1,...,m}<br />Next n lines contain the trip information. <br />Line for i^th trip: s_i p_i e_i q_i <br />Next l lines provide the travel matrix: Each entry in i^th row and j^th column provide travel time between location l_i and l_j, d(l_i,l_j).</p>
<p><br />Various costs in different formulations are calculated as follows:</p>
<p>1. The multi-commodity network flow formulation (MCNF):</p>
<p>Pull-out cost from depot i to trip j = 5000 + 10 * d(l_i,p_j).<br />Pull-in cost from trip j to depot i = 5000 + 10 * d(q_j,l_i).<br />Connection from trip i to trip j is feasible if s_j &gt;= e_i + d(q_i,p_j),<br />and connection cost is given by: 8 * d(q_i,p_j) + 2 * (s_j,e_i).</p>
<p>2. The time-space network flow formulation (TSNF):<br />Each node j represents location (l_j) at time (t_j). Location for depot i is represented as l_i. <br />The start-time (t_0) of planning horizon is zero, and end-time (t_e) is calculated as max(q_1,...,q_n) + 10.</p>
<p>The pull-out cost from node i to node j, where node i represents depot-location i at t_0 and node j represents trip-location j at time t_j<br />= 5000 + 10 * d(l_i,l_j).<br />The pull-in cost from node i to node j, where node i represents depot-location i at t_e and node j represents trip-location j at time t_j<br />= 5000 + 10 * d(l_j,l_i).<br />The deadheading cost from location node j to node k, where node j represents trip-location l_j at time t_j and node k represents trip-location l_k at time t_k <br />= 8 * d(l_j,l_) + 2 * (t_k - t_j). Note that deadheading is possible if t_k &gt;= t_j + d(l_j,l_k).<br />The waiting cost from node j to node j+1 that represent the same trip-location l_j at time t_j and t_{j+1}, respectively<br />= 2 * (t_{j+1} - t_j).</p>
<p>3. The inventory formulation:<br />Each node j represents location (l_j) at time (t_j). Location for depot i is represented as l_i. <br />The start-time (t_0) of planning horizon is zero, and end-time (t_e) is calculated as max(q_1,...,q_n) + 10.</p>
<p>The pull-in arc from node j to node i, where node j represents trip-location l_j at time t_j and node i represents depot-location l_i at t_e<br />= 5000 * 10 d(l_j,l_i).<br />The cost of the inventory arc that starts from depot-location l_i at t_0 to end of trip j at node (q_j,e_j)<br />= 5000 * 10 d(l_i,q_j).<br />The cost of the inventory arc that starts from trip-location l_j at t_j to end of trip k at node (q_k,e_k)<br />= 8 * d(l_j,p_k) + 2 * (s_k - t_j). Note that the inventory arc is feasible if s_k &gt;= t_j + d(l_j,p_k).<br />The waiting cost from node j to node j+1 that represent the same trip-location l_j at time t_j and t_{j+1}, respectively<br />= 2 * (t_{j+1} - t_j).</p>
<p><br />Use C++ file GenerateInstances.cpp to generate new instances. <br />Usage: ./GenerateInstances m n k<br />where m - number of depots, n - number of trips, and k - number of instances to be generated.</p>
