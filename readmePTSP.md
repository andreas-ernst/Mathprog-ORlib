# Personnel Task Scheduling Problem (PTSP) dataset
This download contains the PTSP data set for Personnel Task Scheduling Problem (also referreto known as a fixed interval scheduling or fixed task scheduling with time windows). The data has been used in the following papers:
* Krishnamoorthy, M., Ernst, A. T., & Baatar, D. (2012). [Algorithms for large scale shift minimisation personnel task scheduling problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221711010435). European Journal of Operational Research, 219(1), 34-48.

The format of all of these data files is:

1.   multi–skilling level
2.   type =1 (minimizing the number of shifts/workers)
3.   number of jobs/tasks
4.   job start and end times
5.   number of shifts(qualifications)
6.    number of qualified jobs for each shift and the qualified job indices

The name of the data file presents:

*   the file number
*   number of workers
*   number of jobs
*   the multi–skilling level

For example, Data_10_51_111_66.dat is the 10th data file which presents a problem instance with 51 workers, 111 jobs and with a multi–skilling level of 66%.
There are 137 data files in the data set [ptask.zip](data/ptask.zip).
